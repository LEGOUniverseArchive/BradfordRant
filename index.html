            <h3> POD 6 & 7 VIDEOS ONLINE!</h3>
                <p><span>Final pod videos now ready for viewing</span><br />
                    The mystery of the ozone smell identified by the finder of Pod 7 covered in this video. What does it all mean?

            <h3>POD 4 & 5 VIDEOS POSTED</h3>
                <p><span>Analyses of mysterious pods salvaged from server meltdown</span><br />
                     Finally! Our analysis of pods 4 and 5 are ready to be viewed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bradfordrant#p/a/u/1/ZkpTKWeqftA" target="new">here</a> Thanks to everyone for their patience during our technical downtime.<br>
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <h3>CODE STRING OPENS GATEWAY TO LEGO UNIVERSE!</h3>
                <p><span>Rip between our universe and the minifigs' dimension discovered</span><br />
                Entering the code string into the super computer had explosive results in both our lab and in the universe.
                We seem to have caused a rip in the fabric of space, opening a gateway between our dimension and the LEGO Universe.
                Through this gateway, a great stream of information is flowing into our world. With our equipment down we cannot handle such large amounts of data.
                Thankfully LEGO has agreed to host the information on LEGOUniverse.com.<br>
                     <a href="http://universe.lego.com/en-us/helptheminifigs/default.aspx" target="new">Go there to take part in the next chapter of this amazing story!</a>
                </p>

            <h3>CODE ENTERED INTO SUPER COMPUTER</h3>
                <p><span>See the video of the event that nearly blew up the lab</span><br />
                     Within minutes of posting the answer field, crackers5 swooped in and revealed the mystery for everyone.
                     Your work finding and entering the Pod IDs created a code string that we entered into our super computer last week. As you'll see in the video it had an explosive effect.<br>
                     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bradfordrant#p/a/u/0/XvPcc-QoR64" target="new">See the video here</a>

                     Within minutes of posting the answer field, crackers5 swooped in and revealed the mystery for everyone.
                     He was of course awarded with the first LEGO pod, found in Denmark. <a href="pod_1.html">See it here</a>

                <p><span>Remember the code string. Is there another twist in the mystery?</span><br />
