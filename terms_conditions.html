	The Events are open to all, except employees, consultants, or 
independent contractors of the LEGO Group of Companies or any business 
entity hosting a Find a Pod Event, 
	members of their immediate families, and those living in their 
households.  There are no age restrictions, however if you are a minor

	<p></p><h3>Event Period:</h3>

	<h3>How to Participate:</h3>
	<p>No purchase is necessary to participate and win.  By participating, 
participants agree to abide by and be bound by these Terms and 
Conditions.
	<br><br>
	To take part in a "Find a Pod" event, check the BradfordRant.org 
website frequently for information to help you determine where the next 
Pod is expected to land.  
	Once the Pod has landed, an announcement will be posted on the website,
 giving the exact location.  
	Go to the specified location, during normal business hours for that 
location, and look for Pod Contact Person.
	When you find the Pod Contact Person tell him or her the number of the 
Pod you are seeking.
	<br><br>
	All local laws and regulations apply. Any participant who fails to act 
in accordance with local laws and regulations will be disqualified.
	<br><br>
	Participants agree to hold Sponsor harmless against any and all claims 
and liability arising out of participation in the Find a Pod Events.</p><br>

	<p></p><h3>How to Win a Pod:</h3>
	Many people will participate in each event.  Only one Pod will be won at each Pod Landing Location.
	<br><br>
	The first person to notify the Pod Contact Person of the Pod Number 
will be declared the Winner, subject to the fulfilling the conditions 
below. All decisions of the Pod Contact Person are final.
	<br><br>
	The Pod will be kept on display at the Pod Landing Location for up to 1
 day, after which time the Pod will be mailed to the Winner. 
	As a condition of winning the Pod, the Winner agrees not to sell, 
trade, or otherwise transfer ownership of the Pod for a period of one 
year from the date of the relevant Find a Pod Event. 
	Any attempted violation of this provision will result in ownership of 
the Pod immediately reverting to the Sponsor.
	<br><br>
	The Winner will be required to sign an Affidavit of Eligibility and a 
Liability Release.  If the Winner is unable or unwilling to do so, the 
Winner will forfeit any and all rights to the Pod, and an alternate 
Winner will be selected by the Sponsor, in its sole discretion. 
	The Winner will also be requested to sign a Publicity Release form.  If
 the Winner is a minor, these forms must be signed by a parent or 
guardian.
	<br><br>
	The approximate retail value of each Pod is $50.00 USD.  No prizes 
other than one Pod per Pod Landing Location will be awarded. 
	The Sponsor reserves the right to award a prize of equal or greater 
value if a Pod is unavailable at the time it is due to be distributed to
 the Winner. 
	Any and all taxes are the sole responsibility of the Winner.
	<p></p><br>

	<p></p><h3>Miscellaneous Provisions:</h3>
	With the exception of the Find a Pod Events, the circumstances 
represented on the BradfordRant.org website are fictional and are 
intended for entertainment purposes only.
	<br><br>
	The Sponsor is not responsible for conditions resulting from the 
failure of any computer or communication system equipment or software, 
or from any inability to access information posted on the internet, 
	whatever the reason.
	<br><br>
	The Sponsor reserves the right to make changes to these Terms and 
Conditions.  Any such changes will become effective immediately upon 
posting at the BradfordRant.org web site.
