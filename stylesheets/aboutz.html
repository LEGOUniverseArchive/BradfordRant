                <h2>ABOUT BRADFORD RANT</h2>
                <p>
                    Graduating with honors from Herschel University’s 
Faculty of Applied Sciences (Astrophysics) in 1965, Bradford Rant 
completed a Masters in Physical Cosmology at the Messier Institute of 
Technology; writing his thesis on a critical analysis of Flügel’s 
multi-universe interpretation (MUI).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 1970s, Rant worked as a special assistant to 
Italian physicist Giacomo ‘Como’ Berenices, before returning to the 
United States to take a position at <span class="black_out">31324a0d0a</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was during this period that Rant took an interest
 in the study of heliophysics. Though largely an environmental science, 
heliophysics exposed Rant to the notion of interactivity and in 1974, 
combined with his studies of MUI, he developed the basis of a theory 
what would come to be known as <i>cosmic kinesis</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two years and many drafts later, Rant completed his <i>Theory of cosmic kinesis as it relates to negative curvature</i>.
 Despite being comprehensively referenced, and containing an 
introduction from the eminent MUI advocate, Kennard de Fleur-Rimny, Rant
 had little success in gaining support among colleagues for his work and
 he failed to secure peer reviews for the paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suspecting larger forces were responsible for his 
ostracism from the astrophysics community and sacked without warning 
from his position at <span class="black_out">363536303638</span>, Rant 
decided to set up his own organisation in order to further his research.
 In 1984, the Bradford Rant Institute of Cosmic Kinesis was founded. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A year later, Rant disappeared while on a scientific expedition to Easter Island. He was never seen again.

                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>Dr John Deutschendorf, M.E.Sci, Sc.D, B.Mid</i><br>The
 only recorded civilian to have been given access to the U.S. Air 
Force's Nellis Military Operations Area, John has worked in a variety of
 government and private sector roles. He is perhaps best known in 
scientific circles for his pioneering work in the field of 
archaeoastronomy. John spent two years at the Newgrange site in Ireland 
and before that, four and a half years studying the Nazca geoglyphs in 
southern Peru. He was hand-picked for the Institute by Brandford Rant 
himself and was instrumental, along with Professor Wendt, in developing 
its extensive library of metaphysical and mytho-cosmological materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Professor Gunther Wendt, BTheol, MSc (Astr)</i><br>A colleague of Bradford Rant at <span class="black_out">36393935393732</span>,
 Gunther is a dedicated astrophysicist who holds a special interest in 
astronomical codification from historical and metaphysical perspectives.
 He also likes cooking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Dr Nigel Ponsford-Stand, EngD, DSc</i><br>The 
youngest ever winner of the prestigious Kepler Prize, Nigel applied his 
cosmology background to the practicalities of engineering, with a focus 
on astronautics. Working under the eminent physicist, Ramon Raquello, 
Nigel expanded his studies to include Near-Earth Object (NEO) 
exploration which brought him into contact with the work of Bradford 
Rant. He joined the Institute in 2003.

                <h2>Cosmic Kinesis</h2>
                <p><i>The following is an extract from Bradford Rant's 1976 paper, 'Theory of cosmic kinesis as it relates to negative curvature':</i></p>
<p>... if, as suggested by Flügel's interpretation, quantum decoherence 
is a valid mechanism to explain the subjective appearance of 
wavefunction collapse - and considering all subsequent resolutions based
 on this formulation - then one can only come to the conclusion that 
there are potentially numerous universes other than our own in 
existence.</p>

<p>Given documentation of celestial motion, it is also entirely 
plausible that these multiple universes are shifting. And when one adds 
negative curvature into the equation, the potential for intersection 
along universal <i>paths of transi</i>t becomes a distinct possibility. .</p>

<p>Although little documentation of such occurrences exist in official 
records, certain cosmic phenomena and entities lend significant weight 
to this hypothesis. </p>

<p>Universal expansion caused by the origin of the universe (known popularly as the <i>Big Bang</i>)
 suggests that movement is intrinsic in the universe. And though critics
 of this theory claim that it is not the universe that is shifting but 
galaxies - giving the appearance of an expanding universe - the one 
constant in these opposing schools of thought is the presence of <i>dark energy</i>. </p>

<p>For theorists in both camps, dark energy, which is said to make up 
approximately 70% of the universe, is the essence that causes movement 
in (or of) the universe. One thing all can agree upon is that no one is 
certain what this dark energy is. When one considers that the observable
 universe is just a small fraction of the estimated total size of the 
universe (around 5%), it is not surprising that little is known about 
the origin, composition and purpose of dark energy. </p>

<p>It is this author's contention that dark energy is in fact a separate
 and distinct universe that, via kinetic forces, has shifted into 
alignment with our own. The cosmic element that many in the scientific 
community refer to as <i>dark matter</i> and attribute to roughly 25% of
 the universe is, in this scientist's opinion, not merely another 
section of the universe, but a nebulous area that signifies the 
intersection between two universes along a singular <i>path of transit</i>. </p>

<p>Once again, the scientific community is at odds over the exact composition and nature of <i>dark matter</i>, but, like <i>dark energy</i>,
 they are in agreement over the possibilities; such as super massive 
black holes, small stars, brown dwarfs (the recently coined replacement 
term for <i>black dwarfs</i>) and a mix of subatomic particles. And 
there would appear to be general agreement on the existence of 
interstellar movement, or cosmic kinesis... </p>
